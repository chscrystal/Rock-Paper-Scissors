# Rock-Paper-Scissors

-Added same images for computer
-Added score counting for both player and computer
-Added alert winner after scoring 5 points
-Added hovering transformation for player images
-Added tranformation when player and computer selected their move
-Called setTimeout function to delay the alert of the winner that round

problems to solve:
1.remove class chosen after clicking ok in the alert box
2.after chosen no more hovering effect
3.player selection's tranform after chosen should not be delayed
4.should be: winner reaching 5 points in the display -> alert winner -> clear the score to 0
  now: alert winner -> display 5 points -> click for new round -> clear the score to 0
5.need to figure out about the event loop or order thing
